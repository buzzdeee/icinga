## Overview


The [icinga2](https://www.icinga.org/) modules allows you to setup an icinga2 monitoring system.

## Module Description

This modules installs [icinga2](https://www.icinga.org/) backend only without any user interface.
The web interface `icingaweb2` is available as a [separate module](https://github.com/talamoig/icingaweb2).

It supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL database and assumes the database schema and user have already been created.
If it has not been done, please follow informations provided 
[here](http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/getting-started#setting-up-mysql-db)
for MySQL and 
[here](http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/getting-started#installing-database-postgresql-server)
for PostgreSQL.

## Setup

### What icinga affects

* configuration files and directories (`/etc/icinga2`)
* a new yum repository will be installed.

The yum repository installation can be disabled passing `with_repo => False` to the `icinga` class.

### Setup Requirements

A database (local or remote) with proper credential must be available.

### Beginning with icinga

To install Icinga with default parameters 

     class {'::icinga': }

With default parameters icinga will connect to a MySQL database on localhost named `icinga`.
The used credentials are `icinga`/`icinga` as username/password.
This is equivalent to:

     class {'::icinga':
	   dbtype     => 'mysql',
	   dbhost     => 'localhost',
	   dbuser     => 'icinga',
	   dbpasswd   => 'icinga',
	   dbname     => 'icinga',
	   }

The parameters names are self-explainatory. `dbtype` can be `mysql` of `pgsql` for PostgreSQL database.
Other two available parameters are `enabled_features` and `disabled_features`, eg:

	enabled_features => ['api', 'syslog']

The list of available/disabled features can be obtained with the `icinga2 feature list` command from command line.
The `ido-mysql` or `ido-pgsql` (for database interface) feature is installed automatically according
to the `dbtype` parameter.

## Limitations

This module has been tested only on Scientific Linux 6. 
It should be compatible with any RedHat 6 based distribution.
